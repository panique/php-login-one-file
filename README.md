# php-login-one-file

A simple, but secure PHP login script in one file and a flat-file SQLite database.

No installation needed, ready to go in under 60 seconds. Uses the ultra-modern & future-proof PHP 5.5.
BLOWFISH hashing/salting functions (includes the official PHP 5.3 & PHP 5.4 compatibility pack, which makes these
functions available in these versions too). 

This script was originally part of the "php-login project", a collection of 4 different login scripts made in the 2012-2013 PHP era to give especially beginners and security-inexperienced users a set of basic auth functions that fitted the most modern password hashing standards possible. You know, this was the time when even major companies like SONY and LinkedIn used horrible outdated MD5-hashing for their passwords (or even saved everything in plain text) and when the big PHP frameworks didn't have proper user auth solution out-of-the-box.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3.7+ (with PDO and SQLite extension activated)

## Installation (quick setup)

Run the install script `_install.php` in the `_installation` folder which will create a `users.db` file (the database).
That's it.

## Installation (very detailed setup)

A very detailed guideline [here in this blog post](http://www.dev-metal.com/how-to-install-php-login-nets-0-one-file-login-script-on-ubuntu/).

## Important security note

In the default setup the database - which is only a simple users.db file - can be downloaded directly.
To prevent this, change the path of your database file! A path that is not accessable by public is perfect.
The .htaccess in the project only works if you have set `AllowOverride` to `All` in your vhost / apache config.

## Short guide

The `index.php` does all the action, please look into the code for more info, everything is commented. The install script
`_install.php` creates a database (a file named `users.db`) right into the root folder. The `.htaccess` protects your
database file from being downloaded. The `password_compatibility_library.php` is only loaded automatically when you
use a PHP version older than 5.5 to add the new PHP 5.5 password hashing functions to these older PHP versions.
The `_debug.php` is a little helper tool, it simply echoes out the content of the database.
